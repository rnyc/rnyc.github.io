<h2>A Week with Pluckeye Android</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.pluckeye.net" target="_blank">Pluckeye</a><a> is a software utility developed by Single Eye Software LLC in Oregon.</a>&nbsp;It was <a href="http://www.pluckeye.net/vision.html" target="_blank">created to help</a> human beings who lack perfect self-control. It began as software for traditional computers and it works by giving you tools to limit what and when you consume the internet.</p>

<p>With the explosion of mobile devices, Singe Eye Software made a foray into the Android market by <a href="http://pluckeye.net/android.html" target="_blank">developing a browser</a> that it does not show any media existing on a web page - no pictures, videos, sounds. Why? Because some people enage in online activities they know to be detrimental, but lack the tools and self-control to get the help they need.</p>

<p>But while Pluckeye can do a good job by itself on a traditional computer, the Android architecture needs Pluckeye + something&nbsp;to make a complete solution.</p>

<p>This page is my report on using the Pluckeye Browser on an android device over the course of a week in April 2018.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Developing a Scenario</h2>

<p>In my scenario I am a person with online self-control issues. I want to access the internet but my needs are primarily textual information (news sites). I want to access some limited online areas with full access, and hope to do that through dedicated apps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a trusted friend who (my wife) who is going to lock my tablet down. When I need changes made, she will be the one to unlock it.</p>

<p>(What if I don't have a trusted friend nearby?)</p>

<h2>Step 2: Setup</h2>

<p>The first thing was to get the hardware ready.</p>

<ol>
	<li>I used a Sony Iconium tablet that I borrowed from my employer.</li>
	<li>I installed the Pluckeye Browser.</li>
	<li>I installed a subscription magazine app I use for testing purposes.</li>
	<li>I installed a web-based educational app for testing purposes.</li>
	<li>I installed the Perfect KeyLock App. [Why choose this?]</li>
</ol>

<p>Then I configured Perfect KeyLock App.</p>

<ol>
	<li>You need to give it permission to sees what you are doing.</li>
	<li>You need to let the device be and administrator to prevent you from force quitting it.</li>
	<li>You can then&nbsp;lock&nbsp;every app that you don't want to use to access the Internet.</li>
</ol>
