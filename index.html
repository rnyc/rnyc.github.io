<h2>A Week with Pluckeye Android</h2>

<a href="http://www.pluckeye.net">Pluckeye<a/> is a software utility developed by Jon. Pluckeye's purpose on a desktop computer is to help people limit what and when they view on the internet. Pluckeye can block all access to the internet, block certain domains at certain times, or (most typically), limit what websites are allowed to show images. On the desktop, Pluckeye consists of a browser plugin and a small utility program that work together to enforce the rules.

Android's operating system is set up different enough that Pluckeye could not be directly ported over. So to address the concern of providing help to people who want to limit their internet consumption on Android devices, Jon took the first step of modifying a browser so that no images are displayed. The item is called the Pluckeye browser, and it can currently be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.pluckeye.net/android.html">Pluckeye Android page</a>.

In order to make a complete Android solution, you need to lock down your device so that only the Pluckeye Browser is able to access web pages. This is my report on using the Pluckeye Browser on an android device over the course of a week in April 2018.
